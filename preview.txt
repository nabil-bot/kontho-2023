The relationship between Kc and Kp is that Kc is equal to Kp for gases, but not for liquids or solids. Kc is the equilibrium constant for a reaction in terms of molar concentrations, while Kp is the equilibrium constant for a reaction in terms of partial pressures. The relationship between the two is: Kc = Kp(RT)^Δn, where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and Δn is the change in the number of moles of gas in the reaction.
